Use [admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/), [images](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/), [diagrams](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/), [code blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/), and [tables](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/) to highlight and structure important information or provide additional clarification.

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
