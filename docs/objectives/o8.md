## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Over on Steampunk Island, Bow Ninecandle is having trouble opening a padlock. Do some research and see if you can help open it!

??? quote "Bow Ninecandle"
    Hey there! I'm Bow Ninecandle, and I've got a bit of a... 'pressing' situation.<br/>
    You see, I need to get into the lavatory, but here's the twist: it's secured with a combination padlock.<br/>
    Talk about bad timing, right? I could really use your help to figure this out before things get... well, urgent.<br/>
    I'm sure there are some clever tricks and tips floating around [the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27rE5ZvWLU0) that can help us crack this code without too much of a flush... I mean fuss.<br/>
    Remember, we're aiming for quick and easy solutions here - nothing too complex.<br/>
    Once we've gathered a few possible combinations, let's team up and try them out.<br/>
    I'm crossing my legs - I mean fingers - hoping we can unlock this door soon.<br/>
    After all, everyone knows that the key to holiday happiness is an accessible lavatory!<br/>
    Let's dive into this challenge and hopefully, we won't have to 'hold it' for too long! Ready to help me out?<br/>

## Solution

### Step 1: Find the Sticky Number

Click on the top of the padlock and pull it up slightly to get a little bit of tension. Spin the lock with the arrow keys until it starts to slow down at a specific number:

![Sticky Number](../img/objectives/o8/sticky.png)

Record this as your sticky number. For me, it was 13, but it changes each time.

### Step 2: Find the Guess Numbers

To find the sticky numbers, move the lock back down to 35. Now, put a lot of tension on the lock so that it barely moves (the status should be dark red). If it gets stuck at half increments around a number, record the middle number. If it gets stuck on full numbers, release some tension and move it up half a number. You should find two numbers it gets stuck on in the 35 - 10 range (widen your search otherwise).

My magic numbers were 3 and 8.

### Step 3: Calculate the first digit

MAGIC_NUMBER + 5. So for me, 17

### Step 4: Calculate the last digit

We need to figure out:

    a. FIRST_DIGIT % 4.
    b. magic number, magic number + 10, magic number + 20, magic number + 30
    c. magic number 2 , magic number 2 + 10, magic number 2 + 20, magic number 2 + 30
    d. Which of the results of a and c % 4 == a

So for me, that's:

    a. 17 % 4 = 1

       | Magic number  | MN + 10  | MN + 20  | MN + 30  |
    b. | 3             | 13       | 23       | 33       |
    c. | 8             | 18       | 28       | 38       |

    d. 13 and 33

Then put heavy tension on your lock and move it around those two numbers. The looser one is your second number; for me, that's 33.

### Step 5: Calculate the middle digit possibilities

| Initial           | + 2   |  + 10 | + 18 | + 26 | + 34 |
| :---------------- | :-----| :---- | :----| :----| :----|
| Remainder (1)     | 3     |  11   | 19   | 27   | 35 |
| Remainder + 4 (5) | 7     |  15   | 23   | 31   | 39 |

!!! note "If your value is over 39"
    Just let it wrap around, ie val % 39

Eliminate any values within 2 from your first and third digits. So for me, I can eliminate
19 (too close to 17), 35 (too close to 33), 15 (too close to 17) and 31 (too close to 33).

### Step 6: Attempt all the options

Now just attempt all the possibilities:
* 17 3 33
* 17 11 33
* 17 27 33
* 17 7 33
* 17 23 33
* 17 39 33

!!! note "Maybe try twice"
    I was always terrible at opening these sorts of locks; even in high school when I knew the correct combination, it took me a couple of tries ðŸ˜…

    Oh, thank heavens! You're a lifesaver! With your knack for cracking codes, we've just turned a potential 'loo catastrophe' into a holiday triumph!
