    Hey there, I'm Garland Candlesticks! I could really use your help with something.<br/>
    You see, I have this important pamphlet in my luggage, but I just can't remember the combination to open it!<br/>
    Chris Elgee gave a talk recently that might help me with this problem. Did you attend that?<br/>
    I seem to recall Chris mentioning a technique to figure out the combinations...<br/>
    I have faith in you! We'll get that luggage open in no time.<br/>
    This pamphlet is crucial for me, so I can't thank you enough for your assistance.<br/>
    Once we retrieve it, I promise to treat you to a frosty snack on me!<br/>

## Hints

??? tip "Lock Talk"
    Check out Chris Elgee's [talk](https://youtu.be/ycM1hBSEyog) regarding his and his wife's luggage. Sounds weird but interesting!


## Solution

There doesn't seem to be an easy way to solve this; just hold the lock button slightly down and scroll through the numbers using `qwer` and `asdf`. The locks will stick in multiple places, but they'll mostly stick around the `8`, `6` `0` and `2`

After entering those numbers, push the lock all the way in to see the bag unlock:
