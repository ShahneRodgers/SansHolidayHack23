!!! question "Request"
    Fitzy Shortstack on Film Noir Island needs help battling dastardly phishers. Help sort the good from the bad!

??? quote "Fitzy Shortstack"
    Just my luck, I thought...<br/>
    A cybersecurity incident right in the middle of this stakeout.<br/>
    Seems we have a flood of unusual emails coming in through ChatNPT.<br/>
    Got a nagging suspicion it isn't catching all the fishy ones.<br/>
    You're our phishing specialist right? Could use your expertise in looking through the output of ChatNPT.<br/>
    Not suggesting a full-blown forensic analysis, just mark the ones screaming digital fraud.<br/>
    We're looking at all this raw data, but sometimes, it takes a keen human eye to separate the chaff, doesn't it?<br/>
    I need to get more powdered sugar for my donuts, so do ping me when you have something concrete on this.

## Hints

??? tip "DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, oh my!"
    Discover the essentials of email security with DMARC, DKIM, and SPF at [Cloudflare's Guide](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/).

## Solution

![DNS](../img/objectives/o14/settings.png)

We can see from the DNS record, that emails should come from mail.geeseislands.com, pass DKIM and be mailed to dmarc-reports@geeseislands.com if they don't.

So for this challenge, we can just go into the inbox and read through the emails one by one. If they fail DKIM or aren't `Received: from mail.geeseislands.com`, mark them as a phish. If they pass DKIM and are received from mail.geeseislands, mark them as safe.

For example, the following has been incorrectly marked as a phish:
![Safe](../img/objectives/o14/safe.png)

While this one has been incorrectly marked as safe:
![Unsafe](../img/objectives/o14/unsafe.png)
