!!! question "Request"
    Eve Snowshoes is trying to recover a password. Head to the Island of Misfit Toys and take a crack at it!

??? quote "Eve Snowshoes"
    Greetings, fellow adventurer! Welcome to Scaredy-Kite Heights, the trailhead of the trek through the mountains on the way to the wonderful Squarewheel Yard!<br/>
    I'm Eve Snowshoes, resident tech hobbyist, and I hear Alabaster is in quite the predicament.<br/>
    Our dear Alabaster forgot his password. He's been racking his jingle bells of memory with no luck.<br/>
    I've been trying to handle this password recovery thing parallel to this hashcat business myself but it seems like I am missing some tricks.<br/>
    So, what do you say, chief, ready to get your hands on some hashcat action and help a distraught elf out?


## Solution

??? Background
      In a realm of bytes and digital cheer,  <br/>
    The festive season brings a challenge near.  <br/>
    Santa's code has twists that may enthrall,  <br/>
    It's up to you to decode them all.<br/><br/>
    Hidden deep in the snow is a kerberos token,  <br/>
    Its type and form, in whispers, spoken.  <br/>
    From reindeers' leaps to the elfish toast,  <br/>
    Might the secret be in an ASREP roast?<br/><br/>
    `hashcat`, your reindeer, so spry and true,  <br/>
    Will leap through hashes, bringing answers to you.  <br/>
    But heed this advice to temper your pace,  <br/>
    `-w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1`, just in case.<br/><br/>
    For within this quest, speed isn't the key,  <br/>
    Patience and thought will set the answers free.  <br/>
    So include these flags, let your command be slow,  <br/>
    And watch as the right solutions begin to show.<br/><br/>
    For hints on the hash, when you feel quite adrift,  <br/>
    This festive link, your spirits, will lift:  <br/>
    https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes<br/><br/>
    And when in doubt of `hashcat`'s might,  <br/>
    The CLI docs will guide you right:  <br/>
    https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat<br/><br/>
    Once you've cracked it, with joy and glee so raw,  <br/>
    Run /bin/runtoanswer, without a flaw.  <br/>
    Submit the password for Alabaster Snowball,  <br/>
    Only then can you claim the prize, the best of all.<br/><br/>
    So light up your terminal, with commands so grand,  <br/>
    Crack the code, with `hashcat` in hand!  <br/>
    Merry Cracking to each, by the pixelated moon's light,  <br/>
    May your hashes be merry, and your codes so right!<br/><br/>
    * Determine the hash type in hash.txt and perform a wordlist cracking attempt to find which password is correct and submit it to /bin/runtoanswer .*

First we have to determine what type of hash it is:
```bash
$ cat hash.txt 
$krb5asrep$23$alabaster_snowball@XMAS.LOCAL:22865a2bceeaa73227ea4021879eda02$8f07417379e610e2dcb0621462fec3675bb5a850aba31837d541e50c622dc5faee60e48e019256e466d29b4d8c43cbf5bf7264b12c21737499cfcb73d95a903005a6ab6d9689ddd2772b908fc0d0aef43bb34db66af1dddb55b64937d3c7d7e93a91a7f303fef96e17d7f5479bae25c0183e74822ac652e92a56d0251bb5d975c2f2b63f4458526824f2c3dc1f1fcbacb2f6e52022ba6e6b401660b43b5070409cac0cc6223a2bf1b4b415574d7132f2607e12075f7cd2f8674c33e40d8ed55628f1c3eb08dbb8845b0f3bae708784c805b9a3f4b78ddf6830ad0e9eafb07980d7f2e270d8dd1966
```

`krb` makes me think it's probably some form of Kerberos authentication. If we search for `kerberos` on [a hashcat manual](https://linuxcommandlibrary.com/man/hashcat), we can see the following options:
```
7500 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REQ Pre-Auth            | Network Protocols 
  13100 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, TGS-REP                    | Network Protocols 
  18200 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP                     | Network Protocols 
  19600 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, TGS-REP                    | Network Protocols 
  19700 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP                    | Network Protocols 
  19800 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, Pre-Auth                   | Network Protocols 
  19900 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, Pre-Auth                   | Network Protocols 
```

It probably isn't a REQ, Pre-Auth or Ticket-Granting Service password since it's Alabaster's password and Eve didn't mention anything special, so it's probably `18200`.
Let's try hashcat with that:
```bash
$ hashcat -m 18200 ./hash.txt password_list.txt --force
hashcat (v5.1.0) starting...

OpenCL Platform #1: The pocl project
...
Device #1: Kernel m18200_a0-pure.d7bc3268.kernel not found in cache! Building may take a while...
Killed
```

So it failed for something kernel-related. Searching for kernel in the man page linked above, shows -n, -u and -t can all be configured

??? quote "Kernel options"
    -n, --kernel-accel             | Num  | Manual workload tuning, set outerloop step size to X | -n 64 
    -u, --kernel-loops             | Num  | Manual workload tuning, set innerloop step size to X | -u 256 
    -T, --kernel-threads           | Num  | Manual workload tuning, set thread count to X        | -T 64 

Let's try them at their lowest:

```bash
$ hashcat -m 18200 ./hash.txt password_list.txt --force -u 1 -n 1 -t 1
...

    Aha! Success! Alabaster will undoubtedly be grateful for our assistance.<br/>
    Onward to our next adventure, comrade! Feel free to explore this whimsical world of gears and steam!

Unfortunately it doesn't seem like we can currently use that password:
```bash
$ su alabaster_snowball
su: user alabaster_snowball does not exist
```
