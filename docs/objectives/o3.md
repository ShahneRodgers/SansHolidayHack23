    Hey, welcome to Santa's Surf Shack on tropical Christmas Island! I'm just hanging ten here, taking it easy while brushing up on my Linux skills.<br/>
    You ever tried getting into Linux? It's a super cool way to play around with computers.<br/>
    Can you believe ChatNPT suggested this trip to the Geese Islands this year? I'm so thrilled!<br/>
    Kudos to ChatNPT, eh? The sunshine, the waves, and my surfboard – simply loving it!<br/>
    So, what do you have planned? Care to join me in a Linux session?<br/>

## Solution

The North Pole 🎁 Present Maker:
All the presents on this system have been stolen by trolls. Capture trolls by following instructions here and 🎁's will appear in the green bar below. Run the command "hintme" to receive a hint.

```bash
yes
```

Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a troll and retrieve a present!

```bash
$ ls
```

Now find the troll inside the troll.

```bash
$ cat troll_19315479765589239
```

Great, now remove the troll in your home directory.rm 

```bash
$ rm troll_19315479765589239 
```

Print the present working directory using a command.

```bash
$ pwd
```

Good job but it looks like another troll hid itself in your home directory. Find the hidden troll!

??? tip "Hint"
    It's a *hidden* troll

```bash
$ ls -a
```

Excellent, now find the troll in your command history.

```bash
$ history
```

Find the troll in your environment variables.

```bash
$ printenv
```

Next, head into the workshop.

```bash
$ cd workshop
```

A troll is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the troll is in.

```bash
$ grep -i "troll" *
```

A troll is blocking the present_engine from starting. Run the present_engine binary to retrieve this troll.

```bash
$ chmod +x present_engine && ./present_engine
```

Trolls have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.

```bash
$ cd electrical/ && mv blown_fuse0 fuse0
```

Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0

```bash
$ ln -s fuse0 fuse1
```

Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.
```bash
$ cp fuse1 fuse2
```

We need to make sure trolls don't come back. Add the characters "TROLL_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.
```bash
$ echo "TROLL_REPELLENT" >> fuse2
```
 
Find the troll somewhere in /opt/troll_den.
```bash
$ find /opt/troll_den -iname troll*
```

Find the file somewhere in /opt/troll_den that is owned by the user troll.
```bash
$ find /opt/troll_den -user troll
```

Find the file created by trolls that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/troll_den.
```bash
$ find /opt/troll_den -size +108k -size -110k
```

List running processes to find another troll.
```bash
$ ps aux
```

The 14516_troll process is listening on a TCP port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen.
```bash
$ netstat -aop | grep 7908
```

The service listening on port 54321 is an HTTP server. Interact with this server to retrieve the last troll.
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:54321
```

Your final task is to stop the 14516_troll process to collect the remaining presents.
```bash
$ kill 7908
```
